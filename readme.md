## Presentations Checklist:

### 0. Have Working Code

Start with the basics -- to demo your code it needs to work!  Make a branch __right now__ with the code in a working state. This way you can keep working and know that if you don't finish that last little bit in time, you can `git checkout beta-demo`.

* If your current build is broken consider reverting or rolling back to a previous commit. It is possible to undo quite a lot: [read how](https://github.com/blog/2019-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git)
* This is especially easy if you have been branching and committing often.

> pro-tip: It's easier to undo if you save often. Consider using `git commit` to save your work __every time your code starts working again__

> While developing err on the side of __over committing__. [Insert joke about romance here].

### 1. Write an outline:

Consider writing it on paper -- so you can see it *while* you're demoing your app. It's amazing how much you can forget in front of a room full of people. Having a plan for demoing your app, and *having that plan on your podium* will keep you focused on the things you want to highlight most.

__Resist the urge to "wing it"__. It's tempting to rely on your natural charm, but writing down your plan will make you *look* prepared and professional, because __you will be__.


#### Outline Template:
* Give a high level summary:
  * __What__ does your application do?
  * __Why__ did you choose this project?
  * __How__ did you accomplish these tasks?
* Give a demo
  * Highlight all your killer features:
  * __Be detail oriented__
  * Leave out one feature, see the below:
* Discuss a challenge or difficulty that was overcome (this is a common phone screen question, it's good to practice)
  * People empathize over struggle -- this shit ain't east
  * Remember that time you got *that one thing* working, __FINALLY?__  
    * Talk about that.
  * Then demo the result of that thing. Especially if it ends up being a small thing, or a simple solution
    * then everyone laughs because they get it.


### 2. Practice *out loud*

Go find a quiet corner, or use http://members.galvanize.com to book a conference room for 30 minutes. Film yourself giving your presentation using your computer or phone. Consider capturing a screen cast of the demo.

* Yes, it sometimes looks ridiculous.
* Yes, watching yourself is painful
* Yes, it's worth it.
* Doing this alone will make your presentation 1000x better.

> Pro-tip: you can use a screen cast as your presentation, and talk over the video of you using the app. This way your app never breaks on the big screen.


### Final Note: Be Mindful of The Time

You need a lot of material to fill the time, but when you're in front of the audience time flies. It will be hard to write a plan that seems *long enough*, but you'll run out of time before you say everything you want. __Always__ know how long you speech will be __before__ you give it.

The only way you'll know how long your presentation is, is by practicing __out loud__ and __timing it__ (use your phone) -- no estimate is going to be right.

Master presenters are generally not *naturally charismatic*. They are overly prepared and have __given this exact presentation before__. Probably more than once.
